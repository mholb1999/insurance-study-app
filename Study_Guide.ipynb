        "2.  **Study Mode**: Allow users to focus on specific topics or sub-topics.\n",
        "3.  **Quiz Mode**: Generate questions based on study elements, providing immediate feedback.\n",
        "4.  **Progress Tracking**: Monitor user performance and completion rates for different topics.\n",
        "5.  **Search Functionality**: Enable users to search for specific terms, topics, or MCL codes.\n",
        "6.  **Settings**: Provide options for customizing the app's appearance and accessibility features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Main Screens/Sections:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 1. Home/Dashboard\n",
        "*   **Layout**: Clean, minimalistic design with prominent call-to-action buttons for \"Start Study Session\" or \"Take a Quiz\".\n",
        "*   **Content**: Displays overall progress, quick links to recently studied topics, and potentially a daily study goal/streak.\n",
        "*   **Mobile-Friendliness**: Large, tappable cards/buttons that scale well on various screen sizes. Navigation bar at the bottom for easy access to main sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 2. Topics List\n",
        "*   **Layout**: Hierarchical list view of main topics, with expandable sections for sub-topics.\n",
        "*   **Content**: Each item shows the topic name, associated percentage/number of items, and completion status.\n",
        "*   **Mobile-Friendliness**: Utilizes a single-column layout on smaller screens, with clear visual indicators for expand/collapse actions. Search bar positioned at the top for easy access.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Study Session\n",
        "*   **Layout**: Focus on the content, with minimal distractions. Content displayed clearly in the center of the screen.\n",
        "*   **Content**: Displays detailed study elements (sub-topic, MCL codes, any explanatory text). Navigation buttons (e.g., \"Next Topic\", \"Previous Topic\") are large and clear.\n",
        "*   **Mobile-Friendliness**: Content reflows vertically to fit screen width. Buttons are accessible at the bottom or sides of the screen without obscuring content.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 4. Quiz Mode\n",
        "*   **Layout**: One question per screen to avoid cognitive overload. Clear separation of question, answer choices, and submission button.\n",
        "*   **Content**: Question text, multiple-choice options (if applicable), and feedback mechanism. Progress indicator (e.g., \"Question 3 of 10\").\n",
        "*   **Mobile-Friendliness**: Large touch targets for answer choices. Simple, uncluttered interface to reduce visual noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 5. Settings\n",
        "*   **Layout**: List-based menu of customizable options.\n",
        "*   **Content**: Options for font, spacing, themes, text-to-speech, and other app preferences.\n",
        "*   **Mobile-Friendliness**: Standard mobile settings layout with toggle switches and dropdowns for easy interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Accessibility Features for Mild Dyslexia:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Font Choices**: Users can select from a curated list of dyslexia-friendly fonts (e.g., OpenDyslexic, Lexend, Arial, Verdana). Default should be a sans-serif font. Option to increase font size with clear increments.\n",
        "*   **Text Spacing**: Adjustable line height (1.5x to 2x recommended), letter spacing (e.g., 0.1em to 0.2em), and word spacing (e.g., 0.2em to 0.4em) to prevent crowding of text.\n",
        "*   **Color Schemes**: High-contrast themes (e.g., light text on dark background, dark text on light background). Options for users to choose alternative high-contrast color palettes (e.g., cream background with dark blue text) to reduce visual stress.\n",
        "*   **Simplified Layouts**: All screens will maintain a clean, uncluttered design with ample white space around text and interactive elements. Avoid complex backgrounds or busy graphics.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Elements**: All buttons, links, and touch targets will have a minimum size of 44x44 pixels to ensure ease of interaction, especially for users with motor difficulties.\n",
        "*   **Text-to-Speech Integration**: A prominent, easily accessible button (e.g., a speaker icon) on every content screen (Study Session, Quiz Mode) to activate text-to-speech for the displayed content. Users can control playback speed and voice preferences in settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Responsive Design Principles:\n",
        "*   **Fluid Grids**: Layouts will use relative units (percentages, ems, rems) instead of fixed pixels for widths and spacing, allowing content to scale proportionally.\n",
        "*   **Flexible Images/Media**: Images and other media will automatically resize to fit their containers, preventing overflow on smaller screens.\n",
        "*   **Media Queries**: CSS media queries will be used to apply specific styling rules based on screen size, orientation, and resolution. This will enable different layouts for mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.\n",
        "*   **Mobile-First Approach**: Design will prioritize the mobile experience first, ensuring core functionality and optimal readability on the smallest screens, then progressively enhancing the experience for larger displays."

        "*   **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the legal terms under which the project is distributed.\n",
        "*   **`README.md`**: The entry point for anyone visiting the repository. It will include a project description, setup instructions, how to run the app, contribution guidelines, and links to documentation.\n",
        "*   **`docs/`**: Houses all project documentation. This might include detailed API documentation, user manuals, a setup guide for new developers, and high-level architectural overviews.\n",
        "*   **`data/`**: Dedicated to static data that the application consumes. The `study_elements.json` file generated previously will reside here, serving as the primary source for study content. A `raw/` subdirectory could store original data sources if needed for regeneration.\n",
        "*   **`scripts/`**: Contains executable scripts that automate common tasks such as building the application, deploying it to a server, or running data processing routines.\n",
        "*   **`frontend/`**: Encapsulates all client-side code. This would typically be a React, Vue, or Angular application. The structure emphasizes a component-based approach, separating UI logic, global styles, and utility functions.\n",

        "    *   **Mobile-Friendly & Accessible UI Organization**: The component-based structure naturally supports responsive design by building small, independent UI pieces that can adapt to different screen sizes. Accessibility-specific components or utility functions (e.g., `AccessibilitySettings.js`, `accessibility.js`) would be clearly defined here. Themes for high contrast and adjustable text spacing would be managed within `styles/`.\n",
        "*   **`backend/`**: Contains all server-side logic, typically implemented with Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), or a similar framework. It handles API requests, interacts with databases (if any), and serves data.\n",
        "    *   **`src/`**: Holds the main application code, organized into `config/` (for environment and database settings), `controllers/` (for request handling logic), `models/` (for data structure and database interaction), `routes/` (for defining API endpoints), and `services/` (for complex business logic or external integrations).\n",
